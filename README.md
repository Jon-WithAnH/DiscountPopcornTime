## About <a name = "about"></a>

The goal of this app is to create an environment for users to save their favorite tv shows and movies and allow them to stream those video files. Users can search for any show or any movie and it will pull a list from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/), complete with details, thumbnails and everything that would be expected.
